## üìñ  Description

Pierre's Business is booming and he needs the same pizazz that we applied to his bakery to help sell his new sweet and savory treats! He wants to be able to have a list of treats, as well as a list of flavors and to be able to associate them so that he can have multiple flavors for each treat and vice-versa. He also wants his employees to be able to log in so that they can add, update, delete, and associate treats and flavors, while customers will only be able to view what is available for the day.

This project uses C#, MySQL, Entity Framework, Microsoft Identity, and MVC to create a web interface that will allow the greatest video rental franchise of all time to maintain a daily menu of treats, categorize them by flavor, and allow authorized users to employ full CRUD functionality. The interface will achieve this by utilizing a MySQL database along with Identity authorization.
